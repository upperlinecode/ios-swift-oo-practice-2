//There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin
//C = (F - 32) / 1.8
//F = 1.8 * C + 32
//K = C + 273

//Level One: Add a
//Make a struct called FreezingPoint that has three properties: celsius, fahrenheit, and kelvin. Give them all default values equal to the freezing point of water.




//Level Two
//Make a struct called Celsius that has three properties: celsius, fahrenheit, and kelvin. Give celsius a default value of 0.0, and make the values of fahrenheit and kelvin correct values, converted from the celsius property.





//var tenDegreesCelsius = Celsius(celsius: 10.0)

//tenDegreesCelsius.celsius //returns 10.0
//tenDegreesCelsius.kelvin //returns 283.0
//tenDegreesCelsius.fahrenheit //returns 50.0




//Bonus: Give the Celsius struct a method called isBelowFreezing that returns a boolean value of true if the temperature is below freezing.
